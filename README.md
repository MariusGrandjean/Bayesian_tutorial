# Bayesian_tutorial #

This resource is designed to assist with Bayesian analysis using the excellent brms package. While not exhaustive, it aims to help you select appropriate priors and distributions for use with brms, as well as guide you through a basic data analysis pipeline. It should be viewed as a foundational tool to support your analysis, rather than a complete guide.
